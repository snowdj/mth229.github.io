# Questions to be handed in First and Second Derivatives


To get started, we load the `Gadfly` backend for `Plots` so that we can make plots, and the `Roots` package for its `D` and `fzero` functionality:

```
using Plots
gadfly()
using Roots			
```


### Quick background

Read about this material here: [Exploring first and second derivatives with Julia](http://mth229.github.io/first-second-derivatives.html).


For the impatient, this assignment looks at the relationship between a
function, $f(x)$, and its first and second derivatives, $f'(x)$ and
$f''(x)$. The basic relationship can be summarized (though the devil
is in the details) by:

`*` if the first derivative is *positive* on $(a,b)$ then the function
  is *increasing* on $(a,b)$.

`*` If the second derivative is *positive* on $(a,b)$ then the function
  is *concave up* on $(a,b)$.

(The devil here is that the converse statements are not quite always true.)

We can use the `D` operator from the `Roots` package to find the
first and second derivatives of `f`. Recall, if `f` is a function, then `D(f)` will be a function that computes its *first* derivative and `D(f,2)` will be a function that computes its *second* derivative. If you define this function (ignoring any warnings):

```
Base.ctranspose(f::Function) = D(f)
```

then you can use `f'` instead of `D(f)` and `f''` in place of `D(f,2)`.


In the notes, the following function is used to plot a function `f`
using two colors depending on whether the second function, `g` is positive or not.

```
function plotif(f, g, a, b)
  plot([f, x -> g(x) > 0.0 ? f(x) : NaN], a, b, linewidth=5)
end
```


```nocode
function plotif(f, g, a, b)
  plot([f, x -> g(x) > 1/10 ? f(x) : NaN], a, b, linewidth=5)
end
```


This allows a graphical exploration of the above facts. For example, using it like this: `plotif(f,f', a, b)` will show a different color when $f(x)$ is *increasing* whereas `plotif(f,f,a,b)` will show a different color when $f(x)$ is *positive*.

----

As a reminder

`*` a *critical* point of $f$ is a value in the domain of $f(x)$ for
which the derivative is $0$ or undefined. These are often but **not
always** where $f(x)$ has a local maximum or minimum. 

`*` An *inflection point* of $f$ is a value in the domain of $f(x)$
where the concavity of $f$ changes. (These are *often* but **not
always** where $f''(x)=0$.)




We can graphically identify these points or find them numerically by
finding zeroes of the appropriate function.  To find zeros we have the
function call `fzero(f, a)` to find a zero iteratively starting at
$x=a$ or `fzeros(f, [a,b])` to naively search for any zeros in the
interval $[a,b]$.  (Recall, `fzeros` may miss some values, so a graph
should always be made to double check)

For example:

```
f(x) = 1 + cos(x) + cos(2x)
fzero(f, 1.5)
```

Or to get all values in an interval:

```
zs = fzeros(f, [0, 2pi])
```

The answer from `fzeros` is a vector of values. You can get individual
ones different way or work with them all at once. For example, here is the derivative's value at each point:

```
map(f', zs)
```


In addition, there are two main derivative tests:

`*` The **first derivative test**:  This states that for a differentiable function
$f(x)$ with a critical point at $c$ then if $f'(x)$ changes sign
from $+$ to $-$ at $c$ then $f(c)$ is a local maximum and if it
changes sign from $-$ to $+$ then $f(c)$ is a local minimum.

`*` The **second derivative test**: This states that if $c$ is a critical point of
$f(x)$ and $f''(c) > 0$ then $f(c)$ is a local minimum and if
$f''(c) < 0$ then $f(c)$ is a local maximum.



### Questions

#### Graphical explorations


* The `airy` function is a *built-in* function that is important for
  some applications. It is likely to be unfamiliar. Make a graph using
  `plotif` to investigate when the `airy` function is positive on the
  interval $(-5,5)$. Your answer should use interval
  notation. (Recall, when the second function passed to `plotif` is
  positive, the graph uses a different color, so you need to think
  about what function that should be.)

```
```

```
longq("Commands to plot airy to see when it is positive", "(-5,-4.08) and (-2.33, 5)")
```

* Make a graph using `plotif` to investigate when the function $f(x) =
  x^x$ is *increasing* on the interval $(0,2)$. Your answer should use
  interval notation. 

```
```

```
longq("Interval(s) in (0,2) where \\( x^x \\) is increasing.", "Roughly (0.3678, 2)")
```


* Make a graph using `plotif` to investigate when the function

$$~
f(x) = \frac{x}{x^2+9}
~$$

```
```

```
longq("When on (-10, 10) is \\( x/(x^2 + 9) \\) concave up?",
     L"(-5.196, 0), (5.196, \infty)")
```

* Make a graph using `plotif` to identify any *critical points* of
  $f(x) = x \ln(x)$ on the interval $(0,4)$. Points where the function
  changes from increasing to decreasing will be critical points
  (though there may be others).

```
```

```
longq("Critical point of \\( x \\log(x) \\) on (0,4)",
      "0.367879 is only one")
```

* Make a graph using `plotif` to identify any *inflection points* of
  $f(x) = \sin(x) - x$ over the interval $(-5,5)$. Points where the
  function changes concavity are inflection points (though there may
  be others).

```
```

```
longq("inflection points of sin(x) - x in (-5,5)", "-pi, 0, pi")
```


* For any polynomial $p(x)$, between any two consecutive zeros there
  must be a critical point, perhaps more than one.

  For $p(x) =x^4 + x^3 - 7x^2 - x + 6$, there are zeros $-3$, $-1$,
  $1$ and $2$. Find the critical points using `plotif`. Which critical
  point(s) are between $-1$ and $1$?

#### Finding more precise numeric values

* Use `fzero` or `fzeros` to numerically identify all *critical points* to the
function $f(x) = 2x^3 - 6x^2 - 2x + 4$. (There are no more than $2$.)

```
```




```
longq("critical points of \\( f(x) = 2x^3 - 6x^2 - 2x + 4 \\)", "\\verb+fzeros(D(f), -10,10)+ gives -0.15455, 2.1547")
```

* Use `fzero` of `fzeros` to numerically identify all *inflection points* for the
  function $f(x) = \ln(x^2 + 2x + 5)$.

```
```

```
choices = ["There are none",
	L"There is one at $x=-1.0$",
	L"There is one at $x=1.0$ and one at $x=-3.0$",
	L"There is one at each of $x=-4.4641, -1.0$, and $2.4641$"]
ans = 3
radioq(choices, ans, "all inflection points")
```

* Numerically identify all *critical points* to the rational function
  $f(x)$ defined below. Graphing is useful to identify where the
  possible values are.

longq("Find critical points of f(x), when \\( f'(x)=x^3 - 5x^2 + 8x -4 \\). Classify",
"1,2 are cps, changes sign - to + at 1, so a min; does not change sign at 2, not an extrema")
```


* Suppose $f'(x) = (x^2 - 2) \cdot e^{-x}$. First find the critical

### Concave up has alternate definitions

The Rogawski book defines $f(x)$ to be concave up for differentiable
functions by: 

> $f(x)$ is concave up on $(a,b)$ if $f'(x)$ is increasing on $(a,b)$.


But, not all functions have derivatives. For *continuous* functions, an alternate definition of concave up on $(a,b)$ is that for any pair of points, $(c,d)$ with $a < c < d < b$ the function value at the average is less than or equal the average of the function values:

$$~
f(\frac{c + d}{2}) \leq \frac{f(c) + f(d)}{2}
~$$


* Verify that this holds for the continuous, concave up function $f(x) = e^x$ by picking two values for $c$ and $d$ and checking the inequality. Show your commands.

```
```

```
longq("Commands to verify f((a+b)/2 <= (f(a) + f(b))/2 for e^x", """
f(x) = exp(x)
c,d = rand(2)
f((c+d)/2) <= (f(c) + f(d))/2
""")
```


For any function, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_function) gives a different definition which basically says $f(x)$ is concave up on $(a,b)$ if for
**any** pair of points, $c$ and $d$ with $a < c < d < b$ the has the
secant line connecting $(c,f(c))$ and $(d,f(d))$ lies *above* the
graph of $f(x)$ over $(c,d)$.

This can be investigated graphically. This function is helpful for making a secant line:

```
function secline(f, c, d)
  x0, y0, m = c, f(c), (f(c) - f(d)) / (c - d)
  x -> y0 + m * (x - x0)	# pt-slope form as function
end
```

For a function, say, $f(x) = \sin(x)$, it is used as:

```
f(x)=sin(x)
plot([f, secline(f, pi/6, pi/3)], 0, pi/2)
```

That makes a graph of $\sin(x)$ over $[0, \pi/2]$ and draws the secant line between $[\pi/6, \pi/3]$. This line lies *below* the graph of $f(x)$, so we can say definitively that $\sin(x)$ is *not* concave up over $[0, \pi/2]$. (It is concave down.)


For the function $f(x) = x^2 - 2x$, graphically verify $f$ is concave up by 
showing for any 3 pairs of points between $(-5,5)$ the secant line is above $f$ over the chosen interval. (You pick the the three pairs of points.) Show your commands.


```
```

```
longq("Commands to produce graph of \\( x^2 - 2x \\) and three secant lines")
```

* For the function $f(x) = x^3 - 2x$ find a pair of points, $c$ and
  $d$, in $(-3,3)$ which illustrate that the function is not concave
  up.

```
```


```
longq("Commands to produce graph of \\( x^3 - 2x \\) and a secant line that is not always above graph")
