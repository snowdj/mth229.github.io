# Graphing functions with Julia

## Introduction

The `Julia` language is a new language and as such, certain design
decisions are still being made. One key decision is the interface for
creating graphics. At this point there are many different ones
(`Winston`, `Gadfly`, `Gaston`, `PyPlot`, plotly, plotlyjs, `GR`...),
and perhaps more will be generated before a dominant one is arrived
at. As such, we don't try to teach the details of any one of them.

Rather, we use the `Plots` package which provides a unified interface
to many backend plotting pacakges. This package is loaded when the
`MTH229` package is.

```
note("""Packages are described a bit more [here](http://mth229.github.io/index.html/#_packages_).""")
```

For the impatient, this is all that is needed to know to get up and running.


```
using MTH229  # to load Plots
```

```nocode, noout
plotly()
```


Then, graphing a function is as easy as specifying the function and the domain to graph over,
e.g.:

```
f(x) = exp(-x^2/2)
plot(f, -3, 3) 			# plot f over [-3,3]
```


Graphs can be layered by using the `plot!` function (with an exclamation point indicating a current graph is begin modified):

```
f(x) = cos(x)
g(x) = 1 - x^2/2
plot(f, -pi/2, pi/2)
plot!(g)        #  the domain to plot is optional if adding a layer
```



Graphing two or more functions can also be done by combining two together into a container of functions using `[]`:


```
f(x) = sin(x)
g(x) = x
plot([f, g], 0, pi/2)
```


For the more patient, the rest of the sections cover some additional
details including how to specify a graph by defining the points that
are used to make the plot.


## The plot function 

The most basic usage for plotting a function follows this pattern:

```verbatim
plot(function_object, from, to)     # or plot(f, a, b)
```

as in

```
plot(sin, 0, 2pi)
```



That creates the graphic. The `Plots` package is an interface to several plotting "backends."
Within `IJulia` and using `plotly()` the graph will
be automatically displayed as an `SVG` graphic that allows you to zoom
and pan with the mouse.




```
alert("""

This is another example of a general template **action(function_object,
args...)** for performing some action on a function. In this case, the
action is to plot a function
and the additional *args...* indicate the domain to plot over.)

""")
```




Again, we plot a function, this time a basic polynomial:

```
f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2
plot(f, -3, 3) 
```

### Adding layers using "plot!"

A graph can have layers added to it using `plot!` or other such functions. For example, adding the function `zero` will emphasize the `x` axis:

```
f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2
plot(f, -3, 3)
plot!(zero)     # x axis
```

The automatic legend can be supressed by passing the argument `legend=false` to the initial `plot` command.

Adding points can be done with the `scatter!` command. We put the `x` and `y` values into containers defined by `[]`. For example, the polynomial $x^2 - 3x +2$ has roots at $2$ and $1$, we emphasize this through:

```
f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 2
rts = [1, 2]
plot(f, 0, 3)
scatter!(rts, [0, 0])
```


### Inf, NaN values

`Plots` plots functions by creating a large number of paired points $(x,
f(x))$; it then plots these points; and, finally, connects the points with line segments. In
the numerous function evaluations, it is of course quite possible that some
of the points will return `Inf` or `NaN`. (Where `Inf` is a floating
point value for infinity and results from evaluations like `1/0` and
`NaN` stands for "not a number", and results from indeterminate
evaluations such as `0/0`.)

The values which are `Inf` can not reasonably be plotted. Values 
which are `NaN` can not reasonably plotted. What to do? Such points are simply
not plotted, and no line segments are drawn causing the plot to be
discontinuous. This convention can be utilized to good effect.

For example, to create bounded graphs, we can trim out any large
values and replace them with `NaN`. A function that can be used to
modify an arbitrary function (like $f(x) = 1/x$) and return a function
that can be plotted can be defined as follows:

```
trim(f; val=10) = x -> abs(f(x)) > val ? NaN : f(x)
```

(This is somewhat related to [clamping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clamping_(graphics)).)
Using `trim` is fairly simple. The output 
is a function, so can be passed directly to the `plot` call:

```
f(x) = 1/x
plot(trim(f), -3, 3)
```

This trimming also works when `Inf` and `-Inf` values are encountered,
as both can be ordered by `>`.


### Plotting with anonymous functions

Consider a function with a parameter, `theta`, defined by:

```
function g(x; theta=pi/4)
	 a = 200*cos(theta)
	 tan(theta)*x + (32/a)*x - 32*log(a/(a-x))
end
```

Plotting `g` will use the default value of $\pi/4$. To plot with a
different value, say $\pi/6$ we can create a new function:

```
f(x) = g(x, theta=pi/3)
plot(f, 0, 100)
```

Which works, but is a bit verbose. It would be more convenient to use
an anonymous function, to bypass the creation of a throwaway function:

```
plot(x -> g(x, theta=pi/3), 0, 100)
```

There are many instances where plotting with anonymous functions are
convenient. It can be hard to get used to seeing that arrow, but it
can simplify many expressions if used properly.


### Practice


#### Question

Plot the function $f(x) = x^3 - x$ over $[-2,2]$. How many zeros are there? 

```
val = 3;
numericq(val, 1e-16)
```



#### Question

Plot the function $f(x) = x^3 - x$. When is the function positive?

```
choices = ["`(-Inf, -1)` and `(0,1)`",
	"`(-Inf, -0.577)` and `(0.577, Inf)`",
	"`(-1, 0)` and `(1, Inf)`"
	];
ans=3;
radioq(choices, ans)
```


#### Question

Plot the function $f(x) = 3x^4 + 8x^3 - 18x^2$. Where (what $x$ value)
is the smallest value? (That is, for which input $x$ is the output
$f(x) as small as possible.

```
f(x) = 3x^4 + 8x^3 - 18x^2
val = -3;
numericq(val, 0.25)
```





#### Question

Plot the function $f(x) = 3x^4 + 8x^3 - 18x^2$. What is the smallest value?

```
x = -3;
val = f(x)
numericq(val, 10)
```


#### Question

Plot the function $f(x) = 3x^4 + 8x^3 - 18x^2$. When is the function increasing?

```
choices = ["`(-Inf, -3)` and `(0, 1)`",
	"`(-3, 0)` and `(1, Inf)`",
	"`(-Inf, -4.1)` and `(1.455, Inf)`"
	];
ans=2;
radioq(choices, ans)
```



## Asymptotes

A rational function is nothing more than a ratio of polynomial
functions, say $f(x) = p(x)/q(x)$. One interesting thing about such function is
there can be asymptotes. These can be vertical (which can happen when
$q(x)=0$), horizontal (as $x$ gets large or small), or even
slant.

The vertical asymptotes require care when plotting, as the naive style
of plotting where a collection of points is connected by straight
lines can render poor graphs when the scale of $y$ values get too
large. The really large values plotted near the asymptote can wipe out
the possibility of seeing other features of interest in a graph.


Some features of interest for a graph that are identifiable by
calculus concepts are:

* zeroes
* vertical asymptotes
* horizontal asymptotes (or even slant ones)
* relative maximum and minimum
* increasing and decreasing parts
* changes in inflection

For example, if you want to find zeroes of a function, you really want
to look at areas of the graph where the $y$ values are close to
$0$. However, if you have a vertical asymptote on the same graph, the
$y$ values might also be asked to show very large or small
values. With only a finite number of pixels available, it is
impossible to easily do both.


What to do? If you were on a smartphone, you might be tempted to pan
around to avoid the asymptotes, then pinch and zoom narrow the graph
to the feature of interest.  With `julia` you basically do the same
thing, though panning and zooming is done by changing the domain of
the $x$ values used in plotting.

Let's look at the function $f(x) = 1/x$, which has an obvious vertical
asymptote at $0$.

One can try a simple plot:

```
plot(x -> 1/x, -3, 3) 
```

The issue at $0$ is avoided, as the points chosen by `Plots` do not
include $0$. The asymptote appears as a strongly slanted line, as
individual points are simply connected in a dot-to-dot manner.

Doing better without much work is done by simply restricting the part
that is plotted. (Alternatively, you can use `NaN` values or multiple
functions on one.) For this example, we can easily draw the positive
part:

```
plot(x -> 1/x, 0, 3)
```

It is best to avoid the asymptote at $0$ completely by backing away by
enough to avoid the large range on the $y$ axis. In this case,
starting around $1/10$ is reasonable:

```
plot(x -> 1/x, 1/10,  3)
```


Let's look at the rational function

$$~
f(x) = \frac{(x-2)(x-3)}{x-1}
~$$

This will have a vertical asymptote at $1$, zeros at $2$ and $3$ and a slant asymptote. A quick graph from $-10$ to $10$ shows just some of this:

```
f(x) = (x-2)*(x-3)/(x-1)
plot(f, -10, 10)
```

We can see the slant asymptote and the vertical asymptote, but have no
chance of seeing the zeros or the local extrema. For that, we can restrict
the domain to plot over.

For example, to graph to the right of the asymptote can be done with:

```
plot(f, 1 + 0.5, 4)
```

This shows the two zeros and gives an idea of the relative
minimum. Similarly, a plot of the left of the asymptote can be
illustrative. Here we step back by a bit:

```
plot(f, -3, 1 - 0.1)    
```

It appears that the relative maximum occurs between $-1$ and $0$.


Here we see what happens to the asymptote. The scale of the $y$ values
is huge.  We added a small amount to the left endpoint in case the
function is not defined there, but this function takes the reciprocal
of a small amount and makes it huge.  Clearly we need to really avoid
the issue. It isn't hard -- just add a little bit more to $0$.


One solution to avoiding this issue is to use the `trim` function that
was previously defined. This just caps off really large values so that
the vertical asymptotes don't affect the scale of the graph. We can
see the asymptotes pretty clearly with:

```
trim(f; val=10) = x -> abs(f(x)) > val ? NaN : f(x)
plot(trim(f, val=20), -10, 10)
```


```
example("Trigonometric functions")
```

Let

$$~
f(x) = \frac{5}{\cos x} + \frac{10}{\sin x}.
~$$

Estimate graphically the minimum value over $(0, \pi/2)$.

The domain comes from the fact that $\sin(0) = 0$ and $\cos(\pi/2) =
0$, so we will have asymptotes at each. A simple graph shows there are issues:

```
f(x) = 5/cos(x) + 10/sin(x)
plot(f, 0, pi/2) 
```

As typical with vertical asymptotes, we can't see finer features of
the graph when the asymptotes are drawn. To remedy, we again back off
from the boundaries. Since $\sin(x)$ behaves like $x$ near $0$, we pick
`delta = 0.3` again and expect a max near $10/(3/10) \approx 33$.

```
delta = 0.3;
plot(f, 0 + delta, pi/2 - delta) 
```

With this, we see the minimum value is near $y=20$ and occurs around $0.9$.


### Practice

#### Question

The function $f(x) = (x^3 - 2x) / (2x^2 -10)$ is a rational function
with issues when $2x^2 = 10$, or $x = -\sqrt{5}$ or $\sqrt{5}$.

Plot this function from $-5$ to $5$. How many times does it cross the $x$ axis?

```
val = 3;
numericq(val, .2)
```



#### Question

The function $f(x) = (x^3 - 2x) / (2x^2 -10)$ has a slant
asymptote. One can find the slope of this line using algebra, but if
you prefer the computer, you can graph. Define both

```
f(x) = (x^3 - 2x) / (2x^2 -10)
g(x) = abs(x) > 5 ? f(x) : NaN
```

then plot `g` over $[-20, 20]$. Using algebra or this graph, estimate the slope?

```
val = 1/2;
numericq(val, 5e-1)
```

#### Question

The rational function $f(x) = (x^2 - 3x - 2) / (x^2 - 4)$ has issues
at $-2$ and $2$. How many times does its graph cross the $x$ axis?

```
val = 2;
numericq(val, 1e-16)
```




## Arrays

When we learn how to make a graph using paper and pencil, the "T" method is employed, so
called as we draw a "T" and fill in values to plot for $x$ and $y$. 

For example, a chalkboard after the instructor shows how to plot $f(x)
= x^2$ might have this drawn on it:

```verbatim
x |  y
------
1 |  1
2 |  4
3 |  9
4 | 16
```

As these are the steps done to create the ordered pairs for a plot, we
would like to be able to mimic the following procedures used above in
`julia`:

* choose a collection of $x$ values
* create the corresponding $y$ values
* plot the pairs $(x,y)$ and connect with lines





We have seen how variables can be used to refer to a single value, but
we want to refer to more than one value now. A container for holding
such is an `Array`. Arrays are implemented in most all computer
languages, though the term can mean different things.  We are looking
for vectors, or one-dimensional arrays.  In general, an array is a
multidimensional grid of values -- all of the same type (integer,
floating point, *functions*, ..., or ANY).

For our purposes, we want vectors (one dimensional, $n$ by 1 arrays in
`julia`). These can be easily constructed in different ways.

### Creating 1-dimensional arrays with `[]`


In many different contexts, `julia` uses `[]` to create collections from individual components.

For example, to directly create a 1-dimensional array with the `[]`
syntax one simply types in the values separated by commas:

```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

Or

```
[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
```

These create "vectors."  Row vectors (which are arrays, but not of
type `Vector`) are created when no commas are specified:

```
[13 21 34 55]
```


The notation is that `[a, b, c]` combines `a`, `b`, and `c` vertically
and `[a b c]` combines them horizontally. The former is good to make
column vectors for single values (scalars). 


Row and column vectors are different! We will primarily use column
vectors going forward.



**Containers are for like values...**

In general, `julia` uses `[` and `]' to create containers for like
values. These containers can be more complicated than a single row or
column. One subtle thing is that each object must be of the same
value, though sometimes this happens by a silent conversion. So,
mixing integer and floating point numbers will produce a container of
just floating point values:

```
[1, 2.0]
```

### Creating arithmetic sequences

A basic set of numbers used in programming are the values `1`,`2`,
..., `n`. These are the simplest example of an *arithmetic progression* or sequence, which in general can start in a different
place and have steps of a size different from $1$:

$$~
a, a + h, a+2h, a+3h, ..., a + nh
~$$

It should be possible to specify arithmetic sequences either by

* the start and end points and the number of points employed

* the start and end points and step size.

In `julia` the `linspace` function will do the former and the range
operator the latter.

Here are 5 evenly spaced numbers from $0$ to $\pi/2$ given by
`linspace` (*linearly spaced* numbers):

```
linspace(0, pi/2, 5)
```

The values are not displayed, but will be if `collect`ed:

```
collect(linspace(0, pi/2, 5))
```


The `5` above is optional -- the default
is 50 points:

```
linspace(0, pi/2)
```

### The range operator

The "range" operator, `:`, is used to specify a step size, like $h$ in
the definition above. To get values which step by 1 we simply specify
the start and end values:

```
1:4
```

That isn't so impressive. The description `julia` uses to show this
value is exactly how we defined it, but this range is specifying the
values 1, 2, 3, 4. To see that, we `collect` the values to make an array:

```
collect(1:4)
```

The range operator returns a `Range` object which is much more compact
to store than the array. (The range object is an *iterator*, something
to be stepped through one at a time. Iterating over the elements
specified by a range does not require all the elements at once, so
they are not generated.)

The range operator can also work with a step size:

```
a=0; b=10; h=3
a:h:b
[a:h:b]
```

Notice, the value for `b` is treated as as suggestion, the range will stop without exceeding `b`.


The $x$ values for a plot are typically a sequence of increasing
values from $a$ to $b$. We would generally like to be able to specify
the number of values to plot. This makes `linspace` the go-to choice
to use. 



```
alert("""


Watch the order of the arguments between `linspace` and the range
operator: With `linspace` the third argument is optional and is used
to indicate how many points, whereas with the range operator, the
middle (second) argument is optional, and is used to specify the step
size, which is related to how many total values are generated.

"`linspace(1, 13, 7)`",
"`[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5]`"
];
ans=1;
radioq(choices, ans)
```



## Indexing

A column vector has a natural sense of first, second, ..., the $n$-th
element. This allows `julia` to refer to the values by index
($1$-based, unlike some other computer languages). So, if `x` is an
array, `x[1]` is the first value in that array. One can extract and
*assign* values using indices. A simple example is:

```
x = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]
x[1]
x[3]
```

There are some special values. The `end` value refers to the last ($n$ th):

```
x[end]
```

The $n$ -- or number of elements -- can be returned by `length`:

```
length(x)
```

A range object can be used for indices:

```
x[1:3]
```

The value `end` can be used in a range when indexing:

```
x[2:end]
```

(But not without indexing, as you can see by typing `2:end` by itself.)


```
note("""**Left side of an `=` sign**: `Julia` allows only three
different types of expressions on the left side of an equals sign:

* a variable name, as in `x = 42`,
* a function definition, as in `f(x) = x^2 - 2`, or
* a assignment setting an index, as in `x[1] = 2`.

The left side is quite unlike a math equation, where arbitray
expressions are typical.

```


### Practice

#### Question

Let 

```
x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
```

What is the value of `x[end - 1] + x[end]`?

```
val = x[end - 1] + x[end];
numericq(val, 1e-16)
```

#### Question

Let 

```
x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
```

What is the value of `x[3]`?

```
val = x[3];
numericq(val, 1e-16)
```


#### Question

When a vector is created, if possible, the resulting values are converted to be the same type.  Let

```
x = [1, 2.0]
y = [1, 2.0, "three"]
```

For   `x[1]` and `y[1]` what does `typeof` return?

```
choices = ["(Float, Integer)",
	"(Integer, Integer)",
	"(Integer, ASCIIString)"
	];
ans = 1;
radioq(choices, ans)
```

(The `y` container is of type `Any` which allows it to hold any type of object, the `x` container only holds values of a certain type.)




## Mapping <small>a function to multiple values</small>

To specify the $y$ values we wish to "map" the function `f` to each
$x$ value.  In `julia` there are many different ways to do this, we
list four for completeness, but will restrict our attention to just
the first three styles.

### The map function

The `map` function. In many areas of mathematics, one refers to a
function as a "map" from the domain to the range. The implication is
that the function takes all the $x$ values to the corresponding $y$
values at once (conceptually) and not one at a time. The `map`
function will apply the function `f` to each value in the array `x`,
basically taking `[x1, x2, ..., xn]` and returning `[f(x1), f(x2),
..., f(xn)]`.

For example, let's look at the simple polynomial $f(x) = -16x^2 +
32x$. We define our `julia` function with:

```
f(x) = -16x^2 + 32x
```

If we want to look at this function for $x$ values between $0$ and $2$
we might define the $x$ values with:

```
x = linspace(0, 2, 5)
```

Then the `map` function will create the corresponding $y$ values:

```
map(f, x)
```

The syntax of `map` requires a slight pause. Here we do not actually
call the function `f`, as in `f(2)`. Rather, we pass the name of the
function object to the `map` argument -- and `map` calls the function for
each value in the column vector `x` and returns a corresponding column
vector. 

It is also quite common to use anonymous functions with `map`. For example:

```
map(u -> 10 * u^2, x)
```

We use `u` for the dummy variable in the anonymous function, so as not
to get it confused with the variable `x` holding our values, but this
is not necessary.

### Broadcasting

`Julia` allows a function to be broadcast over a collection of values
with a simple notational trick or inserting a "." *before* the
parenthesis. To see, we have:

```
sin.([1,2,3])
```

In this use, the output is the same as though `map(sin, [1,2,3])` were
called. In general, this "." notation is a bit different, as there can
be multiple arguments passed and the size of the values is matched if
possible by replication. For example, this command find the logarithm
of 5 for different bases. The value 5 is replicated once for each of
the bases:

```
log.([2,pi,5,10], 5)
```

```
note("""
The "dot" broadcasting is very succinct and useful, but using `map` is
more explicit and easier to reason about. Best to start with `map` and
if you find it being used often, transition to thinking about using
the "dot" broadcasting.
""")
```



### Comprehensions

Mathematicians are fond of set notation, as in this way to describe
the $y$ values in a graph:

$$~
y = \{ f(x): x \text{ in } [0, 2] \},
~$$

This is read: "the values $f(x)$ *for* each $x$ in the interval $[0,2]$."

Here we define values `xs` to represent the continuum of values in
the interval $[0,2]$, then use a "comprehension" to create the set
notation above. The syntax is similar:

```
xs = linspace(0, 2.0, 5)
[f(x) for x in xs]
```


In this example we still get a container of type `Any`. While not critical, we would really like to have this be of
type "float", as some math functions care about this
distinction. Converting can be done a few ways:

* by converting the values with `float` (which coerces the values):

```
map(float, [ f(x) for x in xs ] )
```

* By using square brackets and declaring the type:

```
Float64[f(x) for x in xs]
```

* Doing this inside a function, where things work a bit differently than at the command line:

```
g(xs) = [f(x) for x in xs]
g(xs)
```


The two approaches, maps and comprehensions, are equally
useful. Perhaps `map` is a bit less trouble, but comprehensions mirror
a more familiar mathematical syntax and generalize to functions of
more than one variable nicely. One difference to keep in mind when
deciding which to use, is that mapping requires a function, whereas
comprehensions use expressions.



### For loops

Finally, for completeness, we mention another means to generate
vectors of numbers that is more familiar to users of other computer
languages.

The `for` loop is a very common pattern in
computer programming. For speed reasons, some languages (e.g.,
`MATLAB` and `R`) try to avoid for loops for a "vectorized" approach
(see below), but `julia` works well with `for` loops, and they are
generally faster than a vectorized approach.

A `for` loop simply loops over each value in the iterable data vector
`x` giving it a temporary name as it goes. To use a `for` loop to
create the $y$ values requires several steps. The first creates a
container to hold the new values, using the `similar` function to make a
vector of the same size as `x` below (but fills it with
nonsense):

```
y = similar(x);
for i in 1:length(x)
   y[i] = f( x[i] )
end
```

The `for` loop ends with the keyword `end`. Here we loop over each
index of `x` and assign to the corresponding `y` value `f(x[i])`.
      
Conceptually this is the opposite of `map` where we think of the
function acting on the entire column vector `x`. Instead, we iterate
one-by-one over the values of `x` saving the function values as we
go. The use of for loops is called *imperative programming*, as you
describe each step. The use of functions like `map` is called
*declarative programming* as you simply declare what you want and the
computer language does the rest.

In some languages for loops are avoided if possible, as they can be
slower. As well, they can require extra bookkeeping, such as needing to
allocate a container for the answers. That being said, in `julia` they
are widely used for speed and storage reasons. As well, they are used
when we need to refer to more than one index. An example of that is
the following way to create a Fibonacci pattern from the formula $x_i
= x_{i-1} + x_{i-2}$:

```
x = zeros(Int, 10); 		## pre-allocate an integer array
x[1:2] = [1,1]
for i in 3:length(x)
   x[i] =  x[i-1] + x[i-2]
end
```

Related to a `for` loop is the `while` loop. This will repeat as long
as some condition is true. The following pattern reproduces a `for`
loop:

```
i, n = 1, length(x)
while (i <= n)
  print( x[i], " " )			## do something ...
  i = i + 1
end
```

We will use `while` loops when we iterate some process and are waiting
until some computed value gets close to $0$.



### Example

Putting this altogether, to create the "T"-table used to graph $y=x^2$,
we could do any of these:

```
f(x) = x^2
xs = 1:4
ys = map(f, xs)
[xs ys]                                  # integer type
```

or

```
f(x) = x^2
xs = 1:4
ys = f.(xs)
[xs ys]                                  # integer type
```

or

```
xs = [1, 2, 3, 4]
ys = [x^2 for x in xs]
[xs ys]                                   # Any type, as y is -- not the same
```

or


```
xs = 1:4
ys = similar(xs)
for i in 1:length(xs)			   
    ys[i] = xs[i]^2			  # integer, as x[i] is
end
[xs ys]
```


The comments show that each is slightly different for technical reasons, but all display the same values.


### Practice

#### Questions

Does this command produce the values $\{.1, .01, .001, .0001\}$?

```noout
x = [(1/10)^i for i in 1:4]
```

```
booleanq(true)
```

#### Questions

Does this command produce the numbers $10, 100, 1000, 10 000$?

```noout
map(i -> 10^i, 1:4);
```


```
booleanq(true)
```

#### Questions

Let $f(x) = x^2 - 2x$. Which command will produce the $y$ values for plotting $f$ over $[0, 2]$?


```
choices=[
"`[f(x) for x in [0,2]]`",
"`map(f(x), [0,2])`",
"`map(f, linspace(0, 2, 100))`"];
ans = 3;
radioq(choices, ans)
```


#### Questions

Will this command produce $y$ values for plotting $f(x)$ over $[0,1]$?

```noout
f(x) = x^2 - 2x
[f(x) for x in 0:1/100:1];
```

```
booleanq(true)
```

#### Questions

Sometimes the function is used to ask a question. For example, this command answers if the values are prime or not:

```
[isprime(i) for i in 1:10]
```

Showing there are 4 primes in 1 to 10. How many primes are there between 100 and 110?

```
p = [isprime(i) for i in 100:110];
val = sum(p);
numericq(val, 1e-16)
```

(It is easier to write `map(isprime, 1:10)` in this case, which leads to `filter(isprime, 1:10)`.)



## Graphing points connected with lines

If one has two vectors `xvals` and `yvals` of equal size then creating
a graphic for them is straightforward. The basic syntax is

```verbatim
plot(xvals, yvals)
```

For example, to plot $y=x^2$ over $[-1,1]$ we might do:

```
f(x) = x^2
xs = linspace(-1, 1)
ys = map(f, xs)
plot(xs, ys)
``` 


One can place both to get both points and lines. The `scatter` function will plot the points, but not connect the lines. In the following, the `scatter!` function is used. (Not the `!` at the end.) This form adds the plot of the lines to the last graph, rather than make a new one.

```
xs = linspace(-2, 2, 5)
ys = map(f, xs)
plot(xs, ys)
scatter!(xs, ys, markersize=5)
```



## Two functions at once

Now that we know about vectors, we can use them to illustrate how to
graph two (or more) functions at once over the same interval -- just
make a vector of functions and hand this off to `plot`.

For example, to graph both the sine and cosine function we have:

```
plot([sin, cos], 0, 2pi) 
```


Or to compare the effects of a simple transformation:

```
f(x) = x^2
g(x) = 15 + f(x-3)
plot([f, g], -10, 10)
```

To print a heavier $x$-axis, we can graph the function $y=0$, specified through the anonymous function `x -> 0`:

```
f(x) = x^2 - 2
plot([f, x -> 0], -2, 2)
```

With `Plots`, it is also possible to use the mutating form `plot!` to add a graph to the current graph. The above, may also be done with:

```
plot(f, -2, 2)
plot!(zero, -2, 2)   # zero is a function returning 0, useful for programming in general.
```



```
example("Operators, aka. derived functions")
```

Often we wish to plot a function derived from another function. For
example, this is used to add a secant line to a graph. The following
function (which is in the `MTH229` package) will create a function
which represents the secant line of $f(x)$ between two points, $a$ and
$b$:

```verbatim
function secant(f, a, b)
	 m =  (f(b) - f(a)) / (b-a)	# slope of secant line
	 x -> f(a) + m * (x - a)	
end
```

Pause for a moment to see what this function does. The first line
simply finds the slope between the two points $(a,f(a))$ and
$(b,f(b))$. The second does something with the point-slope form of a
line using the point $(a, f(a))$. The tricky part is that last line
defines an anonymous function to be returned (the `x ->` part). So
`secant` is an *operator* -- a function which accepts a function for
an argument and returns a function.

Using this function makes it simple to add a secant line to a graph. 

```
f(x) = sin(x)
a, b = 0, pi/2
plot(f, a, b)
plot!(secant(f, a, b))
```



### Practice

#### Question

Define $f(x)$ to be a triangular function as follows:

```
f(x) = max(0, 1.0 - abs(x))
```

In many applications, the following transformation is employed:

$$~
g(x, c, h) = \frac{1}{h} f(\frac{x - c}{h})
~$$

For constants $h$ and $c$.

Make a graph of both $f(x)$ and $g(x, 1, 1/2)$ over the interval $[-2,3]$. Consult the graph to see which statement is true?



```
choices = ["The graph of g is centered at c=1 and has maximum height h=1/2",
	   "The graph of g is centered at c=1 and has area h=1/2",
	   "The graph of g is centered at c=1 and has area 1/h=2",
	   "The graph of g is centered at c=1 and has the same area as f"
	   ];
ans = 4;
radioq(choices, ans)
```

#### Question


We saw that this command will produce two graphs:

```
plot([sin, x -> cos(x) > 0 ? 0.0 : NaN], 0, 2pi)
```

What is the sine curve doing when the flat line is drawn?


```
choices = ["Oscillating: Going up and down",
	   "Only decreasing",
	   "Only increasing",
	   "Only concave up"
	   ];
ans = 3;
radioq(choices, ans)
```


#### Question

Make a graph of $f(x) = x$, $g(x) = \tan(x)$, and $h(x) =
\sin(x)$. Over the interval $[0,\pi/4]$. Based on this graph which of
the following below seems correct?


```
choices = [
	L"f < g < h",
	L"g < f < h",
	L"h < f < g",
	L"h < g < f"
	   ];
ans = 3;
radioq(choices, ans)
```
